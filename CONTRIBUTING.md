# Contributing to AI DevOps SDK

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

How to contribute:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Keep changes small and focused; one feature or fix per PR.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes where applicable.
- Run linters and tests locally before submitting a PR.
- Ensure commit messages are clear and reference issues when relevant.

Code style:

- Python: follow PEP8. We prefer small, readable functions and explicit typing when helpful.
- TypeScript: use strict typing where reasonable. Keep CLI code minimal and testable.

Pull request checklist:

- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] I have added documentation where necessary
- [ ] All new and existing tests pass

Thank you for contributing!
