# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please do not open a public issue with exploit details. Instead follow these steps so we can respond quickly and responsibly:

1. Privately report the issue to the maintainers by emailing: `security@aidevops.ai` (replace with the repo maintainer email if you prefer). If you cannot send email, open an issue and mark it as private (or use the GitHub security advisory flow).
2. Include clear reproduction steps, the impacted versions, and any proof-of-concept code if possible.
3. If you would like a secure channel, provide a public PGP key and we will encrypt sensitive information.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix. After a fix is available, we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter.

Do not include any secrets, credentials, or private keys in your report. Remove any such data from reproductions before sharing.

Contact: `security@aidevops.ai` (placeholder) — maintainers should replace this with a real contact email.
